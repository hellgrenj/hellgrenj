Hi!

I like to create stuff and share it with others.

...and sometimes my clients let me open source stuff i build for them as well!     
For example:  

[slu-docbot](https://github.com/SLU-IT-arkitektur/slu-docbot)   
A QA bot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), RedisStack, Semantic Search, OpenAI and Python.  




[pg_event_stream](https://github.com/SLU-IT-arkitektur/pg_event_stream)  
a proof-of-concept for using Postgres as an event stream with one or more producers and multiple consumers using topics and the NOTIFY and LISTEN commands.
